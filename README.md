## Hi there, I'm Rajeev!

I'm a graduate ECE student at the University of Washington. I'm also a researcher at the Adaptive Computing Machines and Emulators (ACME) lab working on projects under the [NSF A3D3](https://a3d3.ai/) initiative. 

My work focuses on accelerating Transformer, RNN, and LSTM based architectures on FPGAs for microsecond-order inference latencies in real-time Neuroscience experiments. 

Feel free to check out my [website](https://rajeevbotadra.github.io/) for more information on my projects!

<!-- ### My interestes include:
- Machine Learning for Embedded Systems and Edge devices
- Computer vision on Edge devices (check out my Wildfire response drone project!)
- Coordinated Multi-agent RL -->
